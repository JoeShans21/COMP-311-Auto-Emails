Subject: Let's Get Back on Track in COMP 311 üìà

Hi {name},

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out because I noticed a concerning trend in your recent quiz performance.

While you did well on Quiz 2 ({quiz2_percentage:.1f}%), your Quiz 3 score ({quiz3_percentage:.1f}%) suggests there might be some challenges with the newer material.

This could be due to various factors - perhaps the concepts are getting more complex, or there might be external factors affecting your studies. Whatever the case, I'm here to help.

I'd encourage you to:
- Review the Quiz 3 material more thoroughly
- Attend office hours for clarification
- Consider forming a study group
- Reach out to me with any specific questions
